# üêû Bug Bounty Progress & Practice

Documenting my progress, methodologies, and tools as a self-driven bug bounty hunter.

---

## üéØ Recon & Enumeration (Real-World)

- Subdomain enumeration with **Amass**, **Sublist3r**, **Assetfinder**
- Target surface mapping via `httpx`, **waybackurls**
- Port scanning with **Nmap**, **RustScan**
- Directory and endpoint discovery with **ffuf**, **Gobuster**, **Dirsearch**
- Finding secrets using **Google Dorking**, **GitHub Dorking**, `gitLeaks`

---

## üß™ Testing in Scope

- Crafting PoCs for real-world bugs
- Manual testing of scoped assets for edge-case logic flaws
- Brute-forcing or fuzzing routes (always within policy and scope)
- Identifying API and mobile/web inconsistencies

---

## üìÑ Responsible Disclosures

> [List removed for privacy ‚Äî you can add redacted summaries or links here]

- Submitted reports to platforms like **HackerOne**, **Bugcrowd**, **Intigriti**
- Focused on low-hanging fruit that often leads to deeper findings (e.g., IDOR ‚Üí RCE chain)

---

## üß† Methodologies & Mindset

- Treating every engagement as a full pentest: **enumerate > fingerprint > exploit > report**
- Focused on impact: prioritizing real-world abuse scenarios over just theory
- Using recon automation to scale asset discovery across wide scopes
- Actively staying updated with top bug bounty writeups & HackerOne hacktivity

## üèÅ Goals

- First critical report ($$$ payout)
- Specializing in logic flaws & authorization bypasses
- Building a custom recon pipeline and asset tracker
- Getting private invites on major programs
