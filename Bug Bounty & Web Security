# 🛠️ Projects & Accomplishments (Bug Bounty & Web Security)

A curated list of knowledge, practical skills, and accomplishments I’ve built through self-directed bug bounty hunting and ethical hacking.

## 🌐 Web Security Vulnerabilities Mastered

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
- **SQL Injection:** Manual and automated testing
- **IDOR:** Insecure Direct Object References in URLs and APIs
- **CSP Misconfigurations:** Wildcard usage, CSP bypasses
- **CORS Misconfigurations:** Insecure `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
- **CSRF:** Missing tokens, SameSite issues, session fixation
- **Open Redirects:** Chain building, OAuth misuses
- **Clickjacking:** Demonstrated PoCs, missing frame protections
- **Security Misconfigurations:** Header misconfig, exposed directories/ports
- **Broken Authentication:** Token reuse, login flow abuse

---

## 🔍 Reconnaissance & Enumeration Projects

- Subdomain discovery via **Assetfinder**, **Amass**, **Sublist3r**
- Port scanning with **Nmap**, **RustScan**
- Web fuzzing and path discovery using **Dirsearch**, **Gobuster**, **ffuf**
- Leak hunting with **Google Dorks** and **GitHub Dorking**

---

## 🧰 Tools in My Arsenal

- **Burp Suite** (Community Edition)
- **OWASP ZAP**
- **httpx**, **nuclei**, **waybackurls**
- **SQLmap**, **XSStrike**, **Dalfox**
- **Metasploit / msfconsole**

---

## ⚙️ Automation & Scripting

- Created **Bash** and **Python** scripts for recon and workflow automation
- Automated vuln scans using custom **Nuclei** templates
- Wrote custom **fuzzing payloads** for exploratory testing
- Built brute-forcing utilities (within valid scope and programs)

---

## 💥 Exploitation Techniques Practiced

- Built and shared PoCs for **XSS**, **CSRF**, **Open Redirects**, and more
- Demonstrated **WAF bypasses** via encoding and payload manipulation
- Conducted **API-based attacks** using **Postman**, `curl`, and token tampering

---

## 📚 Ongoing Learning & Labs

- Regular practice on **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, **Web Security Academy**
- Studying CVEs (e.g., **CVE-2024-6387**) and applying them to real-world environments
- Active learner through **PortSwigger Academy**, **HackerOne Web Hacking 101**, etc.

---

## 🏁 What's Next?

- Gaining deeper knowledge of authentication flows (OAuth, JWT, SAML)
- Building full recon automation pipelines and dashboards
- Reporting more impactful bugs to public programs
