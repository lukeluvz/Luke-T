Hack The Box:
(set to change at any time)

-Acquired Knowledge:
  -Offensive Security Skills:
    -Gained hands-on experience in initial foothold, priviledge escalation, and post-exploitation on Linux & Windows machines
    -Practiced enumeration-first methodology using tools like: nmap,enum4linux, linPEAS, winPEAS, bloodhoumd and kerbrute
    -Mastered pivoting through networks, lateral movement, and tunneling using chisel, socat, and SSH tricks
    -identified and exploited real-world misconfigurations and CVEs
      -e.g., unauthenticated RCE, SUID abuse, Kerberoasting,unquoted service paths.

  -Operating System & Service Knowledge:
    -Deepend understanding of Linux internals, user/group permissions, SUID/GUID, cron jops
    -Explored Windows AD environments: LDAP. SMB, GPO, PowerShell exploitation 
    -Worked with Web Servers, Databases, CMS, and custom applications under various security configurations

  -Web Application Security:
    -Practiced exploiting:
        XSS, SQLi, Command Injection, LFI/RFI, SSTI, IDOR
    -Used Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate web traffic
    -Crafted custom payloads for authentication bypasses, token replay, CSRF exploitation

  -Enumeration Techniques:
    -Web & Service enumeration with tools like ffuf, dirsearch, nikto, gobuster
    -Manual recon for custom services, odd ports, hidden parakmeters, and encoded data

  -Tool Usage & Scripting:
    -Used tools effectively in a practical pentest environment:
      -nmap, hydra, john, hastcat, wfuzz, sqlmap, msfvenom, impacket, netcat, etc.
    -Built small scripts in Bash/Python to automate recon, fuzzing or even reverse shells.

  -Cryptography & CTF concepts:
    Solved Challanges Involving:  
      -Steganography, Base encodings, Caeser/Rail Fence ciphers
      -Hash creacking and format identification
      -JWT token tampering, insecure crypto usage
